# Logistic-Regression-Practice
Logistic regression is a process of modeling the probability of a discrete outcome given an input variable.

## Overview
In this project we're given the example of bank dataset. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y) depending pn duration.
I used Logistic regression because of discrete outcome that we need. If you open jupiter notebook file you'll find all important comments that you need to understand the process
of creating the model.

## Used Libraries:
• Numpy – It provides a fast numerical array structure and operating functions.

• pandas – It provides tools for data storage, manipulation and analysis tasks.

• Scikit-Learn – The required machine learning library in Python.

• Matplotlib – It is the basic plotting library in Python. It provides tools for making plots.
